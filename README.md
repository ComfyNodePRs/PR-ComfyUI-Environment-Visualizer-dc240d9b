# ComfyUI-Environment-Visualizer
This ComfyUI node pack allows the user to take a panoramic image and a corresponding depth map, and turn them into a 3D environment, which they can view in an immersive WebXR environment.

## Operational overview
When this node pack is installed, ComfyUI will launch a web server on the same machine when ComfyUI is initialized. By default, the server will be hosted on port 4443, but this can be changed by modifying the number at the top of `server.py`. As WebXR requires an HTTPS environment to run, a self-signed certificate is generated on first launch, which will display a warning when loaded on most browsers. The web page includes a dropdown to pick from previously saved environments, as well as several controls to adjust the presentation of the environment. The user can turn left or right in the environment with the joysticks on a VR controller, or with A/D and Left/Right on a keyboard.

### Included ComfyUI nodes
- **Environment Visualizer**: This output node accepts two image inputs, a 2:1 image for the panoramic skybox, and a 2:1 image for the depth map. The node includes a text input for the environment name, and a toggle to automatically launch the visualizer in a new tab when the workflow has completed. Running this node will automatically save the texture and depth map images into a new subdirectory in the `/environments` directory with the provided name. The `depth` input is optional, and the environment will be displayed as a flat skybox if it is omitted.
- **Interpolate Edges**: This node takes an image, and linearly interpolates the edge pixel values along the vertical edges such that they continuously blend to the opposite edge. This is intended for smoothly blending the seams of the generated depth maps to remove discontinuities. The smoothing will be applied over the given number of pixels on each side. While this approach will work on the panoramic texture, it is more noticeable in color, and is primarily intended for use with the depth map.

## Generation tips
Popular image diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion and FLUX are capable of generating panoramic style images, though they may benefit greatly from a checkpoint or LoRA trained specifically on 360 degree panoramas. Additionally, including phrases in the prompt such as 'HDRI', 'panoramic image of...', or '360HDR' may improve your results. All images should be generated with a 2:1 aspect ratio, such as 2048x1024. There are many tools available in ComfyUI to generate depth maps from images, such as Marigold Depth Estimation, or Depth Anything.

## Standalone use
This WebXR server included in this repository can be used as a standalone utility by running `server.py` manually. The dropdown on the page will display the names of all subdirectories in `/environments`, and attempt to load the `skybox.png` and `depth.png` images in the selected subdirectory. While the skybox texture is required, the depth map is optional. Although running the Environment Visualizer node in ComfyUI will automatically save these files to the correct path, any panoramic images placed in the environments directory can be loaded and viewed.
